#Titanic Dataset EDA

Welcome to the Titanic Dataset EDA project! In this repository, we perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. This dataset contains information about passengers on board the Titanic, including details such as their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

#Overview
The primary goal of this project is to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the demographics of the passengers and factors that may have influenced their chances of survival. EDA is a crucial step in data analysis as it helps us understand the data, identify trends, and uncover patterns that can lead to meaningful conclusions.

#Contents
Jupyter Notebook: You'll find a Jupyter Notebook that walks you through the EDA process. The notebook includes Python code, visualizations, and explanations of each step.

CSV Data: The dataset we're analyzing, in CSV format, is included in the repository for reference.

#Key Steps
1.Data Loading: We load the Titanic dataset using Python and explore its structure.
2.Data Cleaning: We handle missing values, duplicate records, and outliers to prepare the data for analysis.
3.Data Visualization: We create various charts and graphs to visualize the data and understand patterns.
4.Data Analysis: We explore relationships between different variables and look for factors that influenced survival.
